Sure, let's break down each component and concept:

1. **Kubernetes Objects:**
   
   Kubernetes organizes and manages your applications using various objects. Some of the common Kubernetes objects include Pods, Deployments, Services, StatefulSets, and PersistentVolumeClaims.

2. **Pods:**

   Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. A Pod can contain one or more containers, such as your application's container and any sidecar containers. Pods represent a single instance of a running process in your cluster.

3. **Deployments:**

   Deployments manage the lifecycle of your application's Pods. They ensure that a specified number of replica Pods are running at all times, and they handle updates and rollbacks of your application's container images. Deployments are typically used for stateless applications.

4. **Services:**

   Services define a logical set of Pods and a policy for accessing them. They provide an abstraction layer over Pods, allowing other components in your cluster to access your application without needing to know the specifics of individual Pods. Services can be of different types, such as ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, or ExternalName.

5. **StatefulSets:**

   StatefulSets are similar to Deployments but are designed for stateful applications that require stable, unique network identifiers and stable storage. StatefulSets provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of Pods, making them suitable for applications like databases.

6. **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs):**

   PVCs are used to request and use persistent storage in Kubernetes. They allow Pods to use storage volumes that outlive the lifetime of the Pods themselves. PVCs can be dynamically provisioned by Kubernetes or statically provisioned by an administrator.

Now, let's relate these concepts to the manifests we created:

- **postgres-statefulset.yaml:**

  This manifest defines a StatefulSet named `postgres-statefulset` for running a PostgreSQL database. It ensures that a single instance of the PostgreSQL database is running and manages its lifecycle.

- **postgres-service.yaml:**

  This manifest defines a Service named `postgres-service` for exposing the PostgreSQL database within the Kubernetes cluster. It provides a stable network endpoint for accessing the PostgreSQL instance.

- **deployment.yaml:**

  This manifest defines a Deployment named `cms-flask-app` for running your Flask application. It specifies the container image, environment variables (including database connection parameters), and ports required by your application.

- **service.yaml:**

  This manifest defines a Service named `cms-flask-service` for exposing your Flask application to external traffic. It uses the LoadBalancer type to expose the service outside of the Minikube cluster.

By using these manifests, you can deploy both your Flask application and PostgreSQL database in your Minikube cluster, ensuring that they are managed, accessible, and scalable within the Kubernetes environment.
